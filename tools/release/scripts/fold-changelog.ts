/**
 * Folds the per-package changelogs `changeset version` just wrote into the one
 * root CHANGELOG.md, and syncs the root package.json to the version they share.
 *
 * deevy ships two Docker images from one version tag, so a changelog per package
 * describes an artefact nobody downloads (docs/plans/commits-and-changelogs.md).
 * Changesets has no option to stop writing them, so they are gitignored and
 * folded here.
 *
 * They are deliberately left on disk. `changesets/action` reads them back after
 * the version command to compose the Version PR's body, so deleting them fails
 * the release with an ENOENT — which is exactly how the first run of this ended.
 * Being gitignored is what keeps them out of the commit, and only the newest
 * `## x.y.z` section is ever read, so a file that accumulates history locally
 * folds the same as a fresh one in CI.
