/**
 * deevy's MCP endpoint, as the session sees it: on loopback, with no
 * credential, and offering exactly the tools the runtime grants.
 *
 * The session is a subprocess with a shell, running as the same user as this
 * process. Anything this process hands the harness — an argument, an
 * environment variable, a file — that shell can read back, and the Agent's
 * key in an MCP header is every operation the Agent may call, over `curl`,
 * including the ones deliberately left out of the tool list (ADR-0014). So the
 * key stays here: the harness is pointed at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp`,
 * and this forwards to deevy with the header the session never held.
 *
 * It is also where the deevy-tool allowlist is enforced. `tools/list` is
 * filtered to the granted names and `tools/call` on any other name is refused
 * before it reaches deevy, so what a session may call is decided in one place
 * whichever harness is asking, and a refusal is one `denied` event from one
 * source. A shell that reaches this port gets the allowlisted tools and no
 * others, which is the allowlist and not a hole (docs/plans/harnesses.md).
 *
 * Everything else is bytes: the request goes to deevy as it arrived, less the
 * headers this process owns, and the answer comes back as deevy sent it — JSON
 * or an event stream, since a Gate elicitation is served over SSE.
