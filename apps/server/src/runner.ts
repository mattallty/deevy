/**
 * deevy's background work, on the Node deployment.
 *
 * What it does is `runDueWork` in `packages/core/src/work.ts`, which the
 * Cloudflare Worker's Cron Trigger calls too. What is left here is everything
 * only a long-lived process has: the timer, the guarantee that ticks do not
 * overlap, and a stop that waits for the pass in flight so the database is not
 * closed under it (apps/server/src/index.ts).
 *
 * It lives beside the listener rather than in `createApp` on purpose:
 * `apps/web/src/worker.ts` builds one app per isolate, and a schedule started
 * inside it would be a timer nobody owns.
