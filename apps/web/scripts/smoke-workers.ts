/**
 * Drives the built Worker over HTTP on workerd (docs/plans/m3.md slices 4 and 5).
 *
 * `wrangler dev --local` is miniflare with a real local D1 and a real local
 * Queue, so this needs no Cloudflare account. It is a script rather than a
 * vitest file because apps/web's test environment is jsdom and this is neither
 * jsdom nor node's own: what it tests is the deployed shape, bindings and
 * asset routing included, which a unit test of anything the Worker calls
 * cannot see.
 *
 * Seven phases, seven servers, over one build and one D1. The first serves
 * deevy on a configured origin the request did not arrive on, which is how it
 * proves the bindings reached the app. The second signs a Human in, and a
 * sign-in needs BETTER_AUTH_URL to be the origin the browser is on — so it
 * picks its port first, and takes the stubbed GitHub with it. The third fires
 * the Cron Trigger by hand and watches the background work happen on D1, and
 * it signs in too, because what it reads back it reads over the API. The
 * fourth watches the Event log the way the SPA does, over a stream short
 * enough to end while the smoke is looking at it. The fifth is the milestone
 * itself: a Claude Code loop working an assigned Issue over /mcp with an
 * Agent's API key, and a Human deciding its Gate over /rpc
 * (docs/plans/m3.md slice 10). The sixth adds the queue binding an account
 * with Queues has, and the seventh takes it away again — the same webhook,
 * delivered by the Cron path alone, which is what makes the binding optional
 * (docs/plans/m3.md slice 9).
 *
 * Two checks with no server at all close it: that the shape a free account
 * deploys passes a dry run, and that the file the dry run validates is the one
 * the build emitted rather than the one in the repository
 * (docs/plans/m3.md slice 10).
