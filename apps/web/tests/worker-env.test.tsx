 * other side, and asserted at the entry rather than at the helper that builds
 * the object: what the Worker actually hands Better Auth, so a refactor that
 * inlines `workerAuthEnv` at the call site cannot quietly change the transport
 * either way. workerd has no way to fetch by address while keeping the name
 * for SNI, so the Worker takes the core's shape-checking transport with its
 * DNS-over-HTTPS pre-resolution, and the residual race is documented rather
 * than claimed away (docs/plans/m3.md slice 8, docs/OPERATIONS.md).
