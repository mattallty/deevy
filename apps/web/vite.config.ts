 * server, on the port that server itself listens on. `DEEVY_PORT` is one
 * variable for both halves — the server reads it to bind, this reads it to
 * find — so a machine where 3000 is taken (another project, another checkout of
 * deevy) moves both with one line in `.env` instead of patching this file.
 *
 * Read from the environment rather than the root `.env`: the dev task runs
 * through `vp run -r --parallel dev`, which starts the server with
 * `--env-file-if-exists=../../.env`, and Vite's own config is loaded before any
 * of that. So an override for the proxy belongs in the shell or the launch
 * configuration, and the default stays the port `.env.example` ships.
