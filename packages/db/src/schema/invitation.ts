 * An invitation admits one person, where an allowlist rule admits a category
 * (docs/plans/sign-in.md). It is a link rather than an email — deevy has no
 * email Channel until after v1 — so the row holds only the SHA-256 hash of the
 * token that was handed out, the way an Agent's API key is issued once and
 * never shown again (packages/core/src/keys.ts).
 *
 * Spent and revoked rows are kept: the Workspace's history is the Event log,
 * and "who is invited right now" should be a question one index answers rather
 * than a replay. Hence the partial unique index below — at most one live
 * invitation per address — which is hand-written into the generated migration,
 * beside the `NOT NULL` the drizzle-kit rc also needs (ADR-0008).
