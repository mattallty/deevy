/**
 * M2's definition of done, from docs/PLAN.md: "a Claude Code loop outside deevy
 * picks up an assigned Issue, writes a plan Document, hits the Plan Gate, and
 * resumes after a Human approves in deevy."
 *
 * Everything the loop does goes over /mcp with an Agent's API key, and
 * everything the Human does goes through the operations the SPA calls, so the
 * two halves meet only where they would in production.
